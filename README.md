<h1>Brutal Force Generator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
With Python, I created a Brutal Force Processer that will crack passwords through brutal force attack. This type of attack is a method in cybersecurity to gain unapproved access for encrypted data, financial gain, or even gaining control of the system. This project will demonstrate the importance of having a secure passwords. When creating a password the user have to consider the following:
<br>

- <b>Length</b>
- <b>Complexity</b>
- <b>Avoid Dictionary Words</b>
- <b>Repeated Passwords</b>
- <b>Randomness</b> <br>

With this project, the user will be able to perceive how long, in seconds, and the amount of attempts it will need for the program to figure out the user's password. 

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>Visual Studio Code</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
